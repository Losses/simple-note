SimpleNote is a minimalistic note-taking tool designed to fulfill my basic note-taking needs. To be honest, I have never found a suitable note-taking tool, so I decided to create my own.

It provides a straightforward and uncluttered interface for quickly jotting down your thoughts or important information.
